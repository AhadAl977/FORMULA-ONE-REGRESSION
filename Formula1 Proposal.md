### Potential Prediction
There will be an upcoming race in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia and with the help of our linear regression model we will be able to predict the duration of completion the race for each player participated in the race, and the number of laps.

### Data Description
Data will be scraped from [Formula 1 website](https://www.formula1.com/en/results.html/2010/races.html) from 2010-2021 for each race happening within those years and the associated countries they were held in. A sample of the features that will be used to determine our targets are the 'Driver', 'Race Car', 'Race Laps'.


#### Tools Description
The main technologies and libraries that will be used are:
##### Technologies:
1. Python
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. HTML/CS
4. Flask
##### Libraries:
1. Pandas
2. Pickle
3. BeautifulSoup
